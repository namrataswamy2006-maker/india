        <h1>*Puran Poli*</h1>
        <p>Puran Poli is a traditional Indian sweet flatbread, especially popular in Maharashtra, 
            featuring a soft whole wheat dough (poli) stuffed with a rich, sweet filling (puran) of cooked chana dal 
            (split chickpeas) and jaggery, flavored with cardamom and nutmeg, and served warm with ghee during festivals 
            like Gudi Padwa, Holi, and Diwali. It's a festive delicacy, culturally significant,
             and enjoyed as a main course, snack, or dessert, sometimes paired with milk or a tangy curry called Katachi Amti. </p>

        <p>Modak is a traditional Indian sweet dumpling, famous as Lord Ganesha's favorite food, especially 
            during the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi, symbolizing bliss and spiritual knowledge, featuring a soft rice flour 
            shell filled with sweet coconut and jaggery, often steamed (Ukadiche Modak) or fried,

        <h1>*Misal*</h1>
        <p>Misal is a popular, spicy Maharashtrian dish featuring a flavorful curry of sprouted lentils (like moth beans)
             and spices, topped with crunchy farsan (fried mix), chopped onions, fresh coriander, and a squeeze of lemon, 
             famously served with soft bread rolls called pav. Meaning "mixture" in Marathi, it's a hearty breakfast or snack 
             known for its complex textures and spicy-tangy taste,
             with regional variations like Kolhapuri and Nashik misal.  </p>

        <h1>*Vadapav*</h1>
        <p>Vada Pav is Mumbai's iconic, affordable vegetarian street food, essentially an "Indian burger" featuring a deep-fried,
             spiced potato patty (vada) nestled in a soft bread roll (pav), enhanced with tangy tamarind, spicy garlic, and mint
              chutneys, and often served with fried green chilies for a flavor explosion. Created in the 1960s for textile workers, 
              it symbolizes Mumbai's fast-paced culture and is a beloved, 
            quick snack for everyone from students to commuters, available at almost every street corner.  </p>
